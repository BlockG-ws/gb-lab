import Callout from '/src/components/shortcodes/Callout.astro';
import LinkCard from '/src/components/shortcodes/LinkCard.astro';
import Spoiler from '/src/components/shortcodes/Spoiler.astro';

This article offers a sample of basic and extended Markdown formatting that can be used, also it shows how some basic HTML elements are decorated.

## Theme Specifics
This theme came with a set of shortcodes that can be used to enhance the Markdown experience. These shortcodes are located in the `/src/components/shortcodes` directory and can be used to add custom functionality or styling to your Markdown content.

To use these shortcodes, you should first rename the file to a MDX (.mdx) file. Once renamed, you can use the shortcodes in your content like this:

```mdx
import ExampleShortcode from '/src/components/shortcodes/ExampleShortcode.astro';

your content here...
</ExampleShortcode>
```

### Spoiler
Inspired by the spoiler in [Moegirl wiki](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/Mainpage), you can use the `Spoiler` component to hide content that you want to reveal later. This is useful for spoilers in game plots , movies plots, or any other content where you want to keep certain information hidden until the user chooses to reveal it.

To reveal the content, readers can hover over the text to reveal it.
<Spoiler>
    A hot take: the theme is done through what is called 'vibe coding'.
</Spoiler>

```mdx
<Spoiler>
    A hot take: the theme is done through what is called 'vibe coding'.
</Spoiler>
```
You can also display a 'tip' for the reader when hovered:
<Spoiler tip='attention is all you need'>
    A hot take: the theme is done through what is called 'vibe coding'.
</Spoiler>

```mdx
<Spoiler tip='attention is all you need'>
    A hot take: the theme is done through what is called 'vibe coding'.
</Spoiler>
```

### Callouts
You can use callouts to highlight important information or warnings in your content. Callouts are styled boxes that draw attention to specific parts of the text.
<Callout icon='💁' type="info">
    This is an informational callout. It can be used to provide additional context or tips.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">
    This is a warning callout. Use it to alert users about potential issues or important notes.
</Callout>
<Callout type="danger">
    This is an error callout. It should be used to indicate critical issues that need immediate attention.
</Callout>

```mdx
<Callout icon='💁' type="info">
  This is an informational callout. It can be used to provide additional context or tips.
</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">
  This is a warning callout. Use it to alert users about potential issues or important notes.
</Callout>
<Callout type="danger">
  This is an error callout. It should be used to indicate critical issues that need immediate attention.
</Callout>
```
### LinkCard
You can use the `LinkCard` component to create cards that link to external resources or pages. This is useful for showcasing projects, documentation, or any other relevant links.

<LinkCard url="https://astro.build"/>
```mdx
<LinkCard url="https://astro.build"/>
```
<Callout type="warning">
    On a machine with bad network, this will significantly increase build time when no other params are passed to the component.
</Callout>
Or to customize the card further with a title and description:
<LinkCard url="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PC4y1L7mq/" title="Don't check the description" description="Don't click on the link" />

### Blockquote without attribution

> **Note** that you can use _Markdown syntax_ within a blockquote.

### Blockquote with attribution
